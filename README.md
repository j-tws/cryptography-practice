# Cryptography introduction

A quick hands on play on some cryptography concepts based on [Fireship's cryptography youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuyzuNBFWxQ)

Why I do this? Just so I won't be too lost during security discussion.

### Concepts covered:
* Hash
* Salt
* HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)
* Symmetric Encryption
* Keypairs
* Asymmetric Encryption
* Signing
